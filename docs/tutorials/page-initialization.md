It is very common that some initialization actions are needed upon opening a page. This comes with
some complexity because we are using server-side rendering. To solve this issue we use the 
`react-redux-component-init` npm module. 

Please refer to the 
{@link https://github.com/mediamonks/react-redux-component-init|Github page of the module}
for more details.

_note: this page used to contain a more comprehensive tutorial but the Github page linked above
has a better explanation of the issue_
